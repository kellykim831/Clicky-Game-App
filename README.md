# Clicky-Game-App

 ## Description 
 The clicky game is a memory game app that allows users to click on an different images to rack up their scores. The trick is to not click on the same image twice or else your score will drop. 

## Process
 In this clicky game assignment, it required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage the component state, and respond to user events.

 Here is a Gif of the clicky game in action:
